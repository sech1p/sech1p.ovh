					<p>Eliza, polyamorous trans woman born in 2005 in East Poland. I am a lesbian, I love girls.</p>
					<p>Welcome in my private corner, I hope you feel comfortable here. ^^</p>

					<p>I do programming on a daily basis. I'm interested in computers, creating graphics/drawings, (creating) music, art, video games and anime.</p>
